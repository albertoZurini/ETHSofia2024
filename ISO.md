**ISO Draft Standard for Modular Zero-Knowledge Proof System for Tax Certification**

**1. Scope**  
This document specifies the requirements and processes for a blockchain-based modular system using zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) to certify the tax statements of companies. The system leverages oracle networks for trusted currency conversion and integrates homomorphic encryption to protect sensitive financial data during tax calculations.

**2. Normative References**  
The following standards and documents are essential for the application of this document:
- ISO/IEC 27001:2013 - Information Security Management Systems
- ISO/IEC 15944-12:2015 - Business Operational View of Blockchain and DLT
- ERC-20 & ERC-1404 standards (for on-chain assets)
- CEN-CENELEC Blockchain Standards

**3. Terms and Definitions**  
For the purposes of this document, the following terms apply:
- **Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP):** A cryptographic method where one party can prove to another that a statement is true without revealing any information beyond the truth of the statement.
- **Oracle Network:** A trusted third-party service that fetches external data (e.g., currency conversions) to be used within the blockchain system.
- **Homomorphic Encryption:** A form of encryption allowing operations on encrypted data without decrypting it first, enabling privacy-preserving calculations.

**4. System Overview and Description**

**4.1 General Architecture**  
The modular ZKP tax certification system is designed to support companies in certifying their tax statements in a privacy-preserving manner using blockchain technology. The system has two key components:
1. **Zero-Knowledge Proof Module:** Certifies that the total taxable amount provided by the company is correct, without revealing individual account balances.
2. **Oracle Network Integration:** Provides trusted, real-time currency conversion rates and stores the private key used to compute cryptographic signatures that validate the ZKP.

**4.2 Interfaces and Components**  
- **Blockchain Layer:** Manages all transaction records, using smart contracts to automate tax payments.
- **Oracle Interface:** Communicates with Blocksense (the oracle network) to retrieve currency rates and verify signed transactions.
- **Homomorphic Encryption Component:** Encrypts each company's account balances to maintain data confidentiality while allowing aggregate calculations for tax certification.

**5. Functional Requirements**

**5.1 Tax Statement Certification**  
- Companies provide an encrypted sum of their transactions.
- ZKP is used to prove that the total amount is correct and complies with tax regulations.
- Up to five individual accounts can be included in the sum.

**5.2 Trusted Oracle for Currency Conversion**  
- The system must use a trusted oracle to ensure accurate currency conversion for companies operating in multiple regions with different currencies.

**5.3 Privacy and Data Security**  
- Encryption mechanisms must protect individual account balances while still allowing aggregate sums to be calculated for tax purposes.
- The system must ensure that no sensitive data is exposed to government entities, aside from the total taxable amount.

**6. Use Case Description (Spreadsheet Descriptor)**  
This section will describe the specific data flows, roles, and interactions between the components. See attached Spreadsheet Descriptor for full details.

**7. Use Case Visualization (Toolkit)**  
The attached Use Case Visualization (.pptx) illustrates the architecture, data flows, and key interfaces in the system. It highlights:
- On-chain and off-chain interactions
- Communication between the oracle and blockchain
- The homomorphic encryption process for tax calculations

**8. Conformance Requirements**

**8.1 General Requirements**  
- Systems implementing this standard must conform to the cryptographic protocols described herein.
- Oracle networks must adhere to the trusted consensus mechanisms defined by Blocksense.

**8.2 Verification and Validation**  
- Each implementation must pass rigorous testing to ensure that the ZKP certifies the tax statement correctly without revealing sensitive data.
- Governments must verify the ZKP results through the homomorphic encryption outputs, ensuring compliance with tax regulations.

**9. Compliance and Auditability**  
- The system must provide auditable logs to demonstrate that the tax calculation process conforms to the specified standards.
- Third-party audits are required to verify that the system adheres to the privacy-preserving principles outlined in this document.
